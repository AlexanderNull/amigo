* Selenium WebDriver tests for AmiGO 2
  This is still in progress, but we have a start.

** Headless Usage

   Naturally, we'll require:

   * xvfb
   * firefox
   * node (use their repo to get a decent one)

   Running could be like:

   : Xvfb :1 -screen 5 1024x768x8
   : DISPLAY=:1.5 AMIGO=http://amigo.geneontology.org node test.js
