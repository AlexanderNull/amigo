* Selenium WebDriver tests for AmiGO 2
  This is still in progress, but we have a start.

  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs

  We're using Mocha as the testing framework. *TODO*

** Getting Started

   First, if you do not already have it, you will need a recent
   version of [[http://nodejs.org/download/][Node.js]]. As of the writing at this moment, I'm
   developing on v0.10.36.

   Next, after checking out the GitHub [[https://github.com/geneontology/amigo][geneontology/amigo]] repository,
   move into the Selenium test directory.

   : cd amigo/selenium/webdriver

** CLI Usage (TODO)

   To run all the tests:

   : ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g *_tests.js

   Or:

   Very easy, just choose the location of AmiGO that you want to run
   against:

   : AMIGO=http://amigo.geneontology.org node test.js

** Headless Usage (TODO)
   Naturally, we'll require:

   * xvfb
   * firefox
   * node (use their repo to get a decent one)

   Running could be like:

   : Xvfb :1 -screen 5 1024x768x8
   : DISPLAY=:1.5 AMIGO=http://amigo.geneontology.org node test.js
