  <p>
    Unlike some ontology browsers, which give a direct topological
    view of the graph relations of terms, this browser shows the
    logical relations of the term in question to its ancestors and
    children.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you were to select the term "neurogenesis"
    (GO:0022008), you would see the current term in question with a
    yellow triangle next to it. The current term's ancestors back to
    the root would be arrayed above, with their relationship to the
    current term next to it (e.g. "neurogenesis" is "part_of"
    "developmental process"). Below the current term is the current
    terms children, with a similar relationship next to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may switch the top-level ontology by clicking one of the
    top-level term buttons, or you may jump directly to a term by
    typing some identifying text into the input field and selecting
    the term from the dropdown.
